# Stopwatch Web Application

Welcome to the Stopwatch Web Application, a sleek and functional tool to track time with ease!

## About

The Stopwatch Web Application is my second project for Prodigy Infotech, where I delved into the world of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application provides users with a simple yet powerful stopwatch tool to manage their time effectively.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for seamless user interaction.
- **Accurate Time Tracking:** Precise stopwatch functionality to monitor time intervals.
- **Start, Stop, and Reset:** Convenient controls to manage stopwatch operations.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout ensures optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Compatible with major web browsers for widespread accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learning Experience

Throughout the development of the Stopwatch Web Application, I gained valuable insights into front-end web development techniques. From structuring the layout with HTML to adding dynamic functionality with JavaScript, every step was a learning opportunity.

## Future Enhancements

- **Lap Time Feature:** Implementing a lap time functionality for users to record intermediate time intervals.
- **Customizable Themes:** Adding options for users to customize the appearance of the stopwatch.
- **Export Functionality:** Allowing users to export stopwatch data for further analysis.
